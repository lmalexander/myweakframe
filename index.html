            <p class="text-center" id="index-essay">In 1861, a woman writing under the pseudonym Linda Brent published a narrative titled Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, recounting her experience as an enslaved Black woman on the plantation of the Flint family in Edenton, North Carolina. Linda Brent’s real name was Harriet Jacobs. She was an enslaved woman on the plantation of Dr. James Norcom, bequeathed to his infant daughter at six years old in the will of his sister-in-law, Margaret Horniblow. While living with Horniblow, Jacobs talks about not feeling as though she was enslaved—she was taught how to read and write, and lived a very comfortable life. This was the promise her mother’s mistress made to her mother as she was dying, and it indeed was a promise she kept.
